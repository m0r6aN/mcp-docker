# Hypothetical DB Migration Scenarios

## MedTech Solutions Inc. Migration

### Current state:

- On-premise Oracle database (12c)
- Contains patient records, billing information, and diagnostic data
- 15+ years of historical data (4TB total)

### Heavy use of Oracle-specific features:

- PL/SQL stored procedures
- Materialized views
- Oracle-specific data types
- Complex security roles and permissions

### Subject to HIPAA compliance requirements

- Weekly auditing requirements

### Target state:

- Azure PostgreSQL (or AWS Aurora PostgreSQL)
- Need to maintain data lineage for compliance
- Implement column-level encryption for PII
- Modernize schema design while preserving historical data

### Key challenges:

- Data type incompatibilities (Oracle NUMBER to PostgreSQL numeric/decimal)
- Converting Oracle's PL/SQL to PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL
- Handling Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) containing medical images
- Maintaining audit trails during migration
- Minimizing downtime (can't take system offline for extended periods)
- Ensuring data validation and integrity checks

## Simplied Implementation

- Schema conversion
- Data type mapping
- Batch processing for large tables
- Progress tracking
- Audit logging

## Full production-ready implementation 

### Additional requirements

- Encrypted data (for HIPAA compliance)
- Converting stored procedures and triggers
- Network security for data in transit
- More sophisticated error handling and recovery
- User permissions and role mapping
